# TIL: Optimizing React Re-renders

Today I learned about some surprising ways React components can trigger unnecessary re-renders. Here's a quick summary of what I discovered while debugging a performance issue.

## The Problem

I had a component that was re-rendering way too often:

```jsx
function UserList({ users }) {
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState("");
  
  const filterUsers = () => {
    return users.filter(user => 
      user.name.toLowerCase().includes(filter.toLowerCase())
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        value={filter} 
        onChange={e => setFilter(e.target.value)} 
      />
      {filterUsers().map(user => (
        <UserCard key={user.id} user={user} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## What I Learned

1. The `filterUsers` function was being recreated on every render
2. Each recreation caused all `UserCard` components to re-render
3. The filter operation was running even when users hadn't changed

## The Solution

```jsx
function UserList({ users }) {
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState("");
  
  const filterUsers = useMemo(() => {
    return users.filter(user => 
      user.name.toLowerCase().includes(filter.toLowerCase())
    );
  }, [users, filter]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        value={filter} 
        onChange={e => setFilter(e.target.value)} 
      />
      {filterUsers.map(user => (
        <UserCard key={user.id} user={user} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Use `useMemo` for expensive computations
2. Watch out for function recreations
3. Consider memoizing child components
4. Profile before optimizing
