# Building My Portfolio Website

When I decided to build my portfolio website, I wanted to create something that would not only showcase my work but also serve as a platform for sharing my thoughts and experiences in tech. Here's how I built it.

## Tech Stack

I chose Next.js for its excellent developer experience and built-in optimizations. Combined with Tailwind CSS for styling, this stack provides:

- Fast page loads with automatic code splitting
- SEO-friendly pages with static generation
- Responsive design with minimal CSS
- Dark mode support
- MDX for content management

## Key Features

### Dynamic Content Types

One of the main features is the ability to handle different types of content:

- Blog posts for long-form writing
- Technical reports for detailed analysis
- Quick insights (TIL/TIF) for sharing discoveries
- Reviews for books and tools

### Project Showcase

The projects section features:

```jsx
<ProjectCard
  title="Portfolio Website"
  description="A modern, responsive portfolio built with Next.js"
  technologies={['React', 'Next.js', 'Tailwind CSS']}
/>
```

## Lessons Learned

Building this site taught me several valuable lessons:

1. Start with a clear content strategy
2. Design with flexibility in mind
3. Optimize for maintainability

## What's Next

I plan to continue improving the site with:

- Enhanced search functionality
- More interactive components
- Improved accessibility
- Performance optimizations
